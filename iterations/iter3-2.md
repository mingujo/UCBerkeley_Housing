## Iteration 3-2

### User Stories / Functionalities implemented in this iteration
1. User Story: CA add/edit/delete their availabilities
2. User Story: CA logins into the app using gmail account
3. User Story: Enable Calendar/Timeslot view

### ISSUES
- We ended up not finishing the cucumber features for user stories #1 and #2.
This is because thoses user behavior tests should be done with Jasmine. We noticed that Capybara has some limitations to view stuffs on javascipt/jquery.
- We did write many rspec tests though.

### Heroku
