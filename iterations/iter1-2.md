## Iteration 1-2

### Update 
- after hours of discussion with my teammates, we think it will be much more effective 
for both customer and us to make a web application which customer interacts on our app.

(customers will have some nice formatted app to deal with + 
they can just push some button to send notification email +
we will encounter fewer corner cases which might come from Google Spreadsheet API dependency +
comprehend the whole project better by working on testing in the userâ€™s perspective). 

#### Functions we implemented / rspec tested
- Sending an email
- Making Google Spreadsheet API call to fetch data from existing sheet
