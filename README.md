### App Goal
 - Timely notification of staff of any changes made to their apartment showing schedule. Problem: Apartment showings are added and changed ad hoc, sometimes last-minute, and it is difficult for staff to track due to inconsistent communication between staff and the department scheduling these apartment showings.

### Requested Feature
 - Automated email notification of additions/changes to apartment showings to relevant still will remove human error from the communication process.
